### ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION FOR SALES ANALYTICS IN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (PYTHON-SELENIUM)###

- Using Python to create 3 robots to automate the entire process of extracting sales data from Sage X3 (ERP system) to setting up the Tableau visualization

- 1st robot: Extract the excel files (Sales data) from Sage X3

- 2nd robot: Combine the excel files

- 3rd robot: Upload the merged file to the Azure MySQL Database

- Synchronise the local database with Azure MySQL database (To keep the data up to date)

- Connect Tableau Cloud and local database by using Tableau Bridge

- Tableau visualization will be updated when it arrives at the data refresh scheduled time.

- Manage to show an exponential of 600% increase in speed to combine the excel files and 800% upgrade in speed to upload the extracted data to Azure MySQL Database
